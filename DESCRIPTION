Description: An EM algorithm, Karl et al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.004>, is used to estimate the generalized, variable, and complete persistence models, Mariano et al. (2010) <doi:10.3102/1076998609346967>. These are multiple-membership linear mixed models with teachers modeled as "G-side" effects and students modeled with either "G-side" or "R-side" effects.
