Version 2.0-0: 2012-07-05
	
	- Improved scalability of program when student.side=”R”. 
	  For smaller data sets, certain operations work faster 
	  with dense matrices, but these matrices grow in size 
	  with the data. For large data sets, we now rely 
	  exclusively on sparse matrices.

	- Added support for the variable persistence (VP) model,
	  including the ability to estimate the persistence 
	  parameters. As special cases, the complete and zero 
	  persistence models have also been included.

Version 1.1-0: 2012-04-03

	- Corrected issue where program crashed when updated
          covariance matrix was not symmetric due to rounding
          (i.e. transposed compoenents may have differered by
          1E-14 or so).
        
        - Added caterpillar plots to plot() output.


Version 1.0-0: 2012-02-19

        - First public release.
